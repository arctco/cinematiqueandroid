# cinematique

**Movies. TV. Anime. Privacy. No ads. No nonsense.**

A local-first media tracker built for people who love film, television, and anime—but don't want to give up their privacy for it. Your data stays yours. No accounts, no tracking, no algorithmic manipulation.

> **Note:** This repository is for **Android app releases**. It does not contain source code. Visit [cinematique.me](https://cinematique.me) for the web version.

## What Makes cinematique Different

### Privacy First
All your data is stored locally on your device. No mandatory accounts, no analytics, no data harvesting. Optional cloud sync via Google Drive keeps you in control.

### Cross-Platform Sync
Link your accounts from **Trakt**, **Simkl**, **TMDB**, **AniList**, and **MyAnimeList**. Bidirectional sync keeps your watch history, ratings, and lists in harmony across platforms—without the manual babysitting.

### The Anime Sanctuary
Dedicated anime hub with seasonal trends, AniList ratings, Romaji title support, and specialized genre tags (Isekai, Shounen, Slice of Life). Because your anime obsession deserves its own space.

### Optional AI Tools
Summaries, recommendations, and smart suggestions powered by Google Gemini—only if you want them. No robot takeover. You control when and how AI features are used.

### Beautiful & Customizable
Themes, accent colors, font sizes, high contrast mode. Make it yours. The interface adapts to your preferences, not ours.

### Import Your History
Bring your IMDb ratings and watch history home with CSV import. Your decade of 7/10 ratings, finally in one place.
